# -Lab---AutoEncoders
In the previous lab we used XGBoost, a powerful and efficient tree-based algorithm for classification of anomalies. We were able to almost perfectly identify the anomalous data in the KDD99 dataset and which type of anomaly occurred.  However, in the real-world, *labeled* data can be expensive and hard to come by. Especially with network security, zero-day attacks can be the most challenging and also the most important attacks to detect. Since, by definition, these attacks are happening for the first time, there will be no way to have labels from them.
